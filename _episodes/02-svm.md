# Support vector machines (SVMs)

Support vector machines (SVMs) are a particular machine learning technique in the broader group of kernel based methods, just as random forests are one of many tree based methods. Unlike the last category, this module will be focusing on a single kernel-based method.

SVMs are associated with two parts: (1) defining a decision boundary using support vectors, and (2)

## SVMs in low dimensional space



## Moving SVMs to higher dimensional space



## The kernel trick



## SVMs in practice with Python
