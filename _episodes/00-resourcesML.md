# Machine Learning Resources

## Support Vector Machine/Random Forest/etc

1. [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
1. [vowpal wabbit](https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit/wiki)
1. [xgboost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Deep Learning

1. [AWS Deep learning AMI](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/amis/)
1. [MXNet](https://mxnet.apache.org)
1. [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org)
1. [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org)
1. [pyTorch](https://pytorch.org) (python Torch)
1. [Keras](https://keras.io) (api for python that plays with TensorFlow, Theano, and others)

## ESRI + QGIS

Machine learning capabilities exist in both ESRI & QGIS (support vector machine), however for scaling to large image sets, opensource scripting is nicely adaptable.
